"description": "Summer in Bethlehem is a  Indian Malayalam-language romantic comedy film directed by Sibi Malayil and written by Ranjith. It was produced by Siyad Koker under the company Kokers Films. The film stars Suresh Gopi, Jayaram, and Manju Warrier, along with a cameo appearance by Mohanlal. The music was composed by Vidyasagar. It tells the story of Ravishankar (Jayaram), the bumbling friend of a successful landowner Dennis (Gopi), and the vacation visit by Ravishankar's relatives in Dennis's estate known as Bethlehem Estates in Chandragiri.\n\nThe film was shot among the forest hills and farms of Ooty, Tamil Nadu.The film was well received by critics and became a blockbuster at the box office. The film was partially remade in Tamil as Lesa Lesa directed by Priyadarshan. \n\nRavishankar (Jayaram), an unsuccessful investor, stays with Dennis (Suresh Gopi), his friend who is successful in farming business. Dennis owns a vast farmland named Bethlehem, and hundreds of cattle, in a valley. Ravi is a fun-loving, jovial chap, who has fabricated stories of his success to his parents and relatives.\n\nOn a vacation, Colonel C.R. Menon (Janardhanan), his grandfather and grandmother (Sukumari) arrive with their extended family to spend a couple of days at the farmhouse of Ravishankar. He successfully makes them believe that he is the real owner of Bethlehem, and Dennis is his partner. Dennis, who is an orphan, was happy to meet a huge family and welcomes them with full heart. Colonel Menon has a plan to get Ravishankar married to any one of his granddaughters. Ravishankar is a bit confused about whom he should choose. To make matters complicated, he had been receiving messages and letters from one of the five girls expressing her love for him. Meanwhile, a few days after their arrival at Bethlehem, Abhirami (Manju Warrier), another granddaughter of Menon, who is studying in Bangalore arrives alone. She seems to be too upset and worried. But within short time, she returns to normalcy and enjoys the colors of vacation. During their stay, Ravi and Dennis decide to discover the girl who had been teasing them with the cryptic messages.\n\nDennis begins suspecting Abhirami of being the sender but she informs him that she is not and that she would help them in finding the person. She asks around among her cousins but everyone denies them being the sender. However, Dennis begins to fall for her and to make matters complicated, Ravi confesses to him that he plans on proposing to Abhirami. To avoid a situation, Dennis hides his true feelings from everyone.\n\nColonel Menon and his wife approve of Ravi's and Abhirami's relationship but upon knowing this, Abhirami snubs them by declaring that she is in love with Dennis. Her decision creates a panic among all, who believes that Dennis is a failed businessman who is living at the expense of Ravishankar. Ravi shocks everyone by revealing that Dennis is the actual owner of Bethlehem and that he is more than happy to see Abhirami getting married to Dennis. Abhirami meets Dennis who is completely broken down after the chaos at the house. Dennis, at the same time, is happy at heart knowing about Abhirami's love for him. But she shocks him by saying that she was just using his name to escape the marriage. She tells Dennis that she is in love with Niranjan (Mohanlal), a Naxal revolutionary in southern Karnataka. Niranjan, whom she met in Bangalore, is now in jail, convicted of killing Brijesh Mallaya, a landlord and his family. He is awaiting his execution in a couple of days and Abhirami has taken a vow not to marry anyone other than Niranjan.\n\nBut at home, upon the compulsion from Ravi, the family decides to get Abhirami married to Dennis. The night before wedding, Abhirami requests Dennis to take her to jail to meet Niranjan for one last time. They meet Niranjan (Mohanlal), who is a completely changed man. Remorseful Niranjan regrets the violent ways he adopted in class war and the crimes he did to obtain a classless society. Niranjan advises Abhirami to forget him and accept Dennis as her husband. Abhirami refuses to take his words, but Niranjan forces Dennis to tie the thali to Abhirami, which she has brought with her. Dennis obeys Niranjan, marries Abhirami at the jail, and Niranjan witnesses it with tearful eyes.\n\nA few days later, the family returns home, while Ravi jokingly reminds everyone that they should be back here next year to welcome junior Dennis. The train departs slowly and a girl's hand reaches out of the coach window, holding the kitten which was sent as a gift to Ravi before. Ravi takes off running to find out who it is, but he catches only a cryptic message that teases him to follow and discover her identity.",

"description": "Kunju Daivam is an Indian Malayalam film written and directed Jeo Baby, starring Adish Praveen, Joju George, Reina Maria, Sidhartha Siva as lead characters. Kunju Daivam' was last in the news when its lead Adish Praveen won the National Film Award for Best Child Artist[1]. The film was produced by Nasib B R and Sanu S Nair under the banner of Ocean Pictures. It's Jeo Baby' second project in Malayalam as a director after 2 Penkuttikal[2]. An ode to the age of innocence, Oru Kunju Daivam tells the story of a spirited boy and his little world full of miracles. Mathews Pulickan has composed the soundtrack and background score for the film. \n\nA little boy who dreads of math homeworks, dreads exams and believes that God will save him from all his problems, Ouseppachan is the 'head' of his small family in the absence of his father, who works abroad. A God-fearing boy, who never misses a Mass, he regularly prays to God to make him taller, help him win the online game 'Criminal Case' and make his math teacher fall from his bike or wouldn't mind praying to God for somebody's death so that he doesn't have to attend school. Most of his prayers somehow happen, much to his joy. Once, he prays to God to let someone die so that he could bunk school, but it is his grandfather, to whom he is quite close, who passes away. Overpowered by grief and guilt thinking that it was his prayers that caused the death, Ouseppachan decides to redeem himself by saving someone from death - not only through prayers, but also by the virtue of his deeds. That's when a sick girl, Katha Jeevan, comes into his life. The movie stresses on the theme that divinity is innocence itself.\n\nAn ode to the age of innocence, Kunju Daivam tells the story of a spirited boy and his little world full of miracles.",

It all starts when Vasu's friend (Dhamu) loses an Annamalai movie reel to Mohana (Shalini). Vasu and Mohana clash when he attempts to retrieve the reel. Mohana's family are members of the police, headed by Birla Bose (Nasser), Mohana's father.\n\nAt this point, Tulasi Das (Raghuvaran), an ex-mafia \"dada\" who spent many years in jail because of Birla Bose, comes to the theater. He doesn't like Bose, and hires Vasu to kidnap Mohana. He cries out his woes in the song \"Satham Illatha.\" Mohana falls in love with him, after hearing his pain.\n\nWhen Tulasi Das realizes Mohana loves Vasu, he hires Vasu further to pretend he loves her back. At first with Vasu it's just pretend, but then, he too begins to love her. Tulasi Das visits Birla Bose to inform him of his daughter's love for a gangster, and realizes Mohana is indeed his daughter. A flashback showing the parted friendship between the two men, and Ganga (Raadhika), Tulasi Das's wife, abandons him and their child when she comes to know her husband is a don. Knowing that Mohana is his daughter, Tulasi Das instructs Vasu to give up his love. When Vasu refuses, Tulasi Das visits Mohana and tells her about his ploy and that Vasu's love for her was fake.\n\nEventually Vasu proves to Mohana that his love was true and unites with her after a clash between the cops and some goons of the locality.",

"description": "For More Movies Please Subscribe  http://goo.gl/yAqkeA\n\n\nSummer in Bethlehem is a 1998 Indian Malayalam-language romantic comedy drama film written by Ranjith and directed by Sibi Malayil. It stars Suresh Gopi, Jayaram, and Manju Warrier in the lead roles, along with a cameo appearance by Mohanlal. The music was composed by Vidyasagar.\n\nThe film was shot among the forest hills and farms of Ooty, Tamil Nadu. It tells the story of Ravishankar (Jayaram), the bumbling friend of a successful landowner Dennis (Suresh Gopi), and the vacation visit by Ravishankar's relatives in Dennis's estate known as Bethlehem Estates in Chandragiri. The film was released alongside the Mohanlal & Mammootty starrer-Harikrishnans and it became the second highest-grossing Malayalam film of 1998 after Harikrishnans.\n\nRavishankar (Jayaram), an unsuccessful investor, stays with Dennis (Suresh Gopi), his friend who is successful in farming business. Dennis owns a vast farmland named Bethlehem, and hundreds of cattle, in a valley. Ravi is a fun-loving, jovial chap, who has fabricated stories of his success to his parents and relatives.\n\nOn a vacation, Colonel C.R. Menon (Janardhanan), his grandfather and grandmother (Sukumari) arrive with their extended family to spend a couple of days at the farmhouse of Ravishankar. He successfully makes them believe that he is the real owner of Bethlehem, and Dennis is his partner. Dennis, who is an orphan, was happy to meet a huge family and welcomes them with full heart. Colonel Menon has a plan to get Ravishankar married to any one of his granddaughters. Ravishankar is a bit confused about whom he should choose. To make matters complicated, he had been receiving messages and letters from one of the five girls expressing her love for him. Meanwhile, a few days after their arrival at Bethlehem, Abhirami (Manju Warrier), another granddaughter of Menon, who is studying in Bangalore arrives alone. She seems to be too upset and worried. But within short time, she returns to normalcy and enjoys the colors of vacation. During their stay, Ravi and Dennis decide to discover the girl who had been teasing them with the cryptic messages.\n\nDennis begins suspecting Abhirami of being the sender but she informs him that she is not and that she would help them in finding the person. She asks around among her cousins but everyone denies them being the sender. However, Dennis begins to fall for her and to make matters complicated, Ravi confesses to him that he plans on proposing to Abhirami. To avoid a situation, Dennis hides his true feelings from everyone.\n\nColonel Menon and his wife approve of Ravi's and Abhirami's relationship but upon knowing this, Abhirami snubs them by declaring that she is in love with Dennis. Her decision creates a panic among all, who believes that Dennis is a failed businessman who is living at the expense of Ravishankar. Ravi shocks everyone by revealing that Dennis is the actual owner of Bethlehem and that he is more than happy to see Abhirami getting married to Dennis. Abhirami meets Dennis who is completely broken down after the chaos at the house. Dennis, at the same time, is happy at heart knowing about Abhirami's love for him. But she shocks him by saying that she was just using his name to escape the marriage. She tells Dennis that she is in love with Niranjan (Mohanlal), a Naxal revolutionary in southern Karnataka. Niranjan, whom she met in Bangalore, is now in jail, convicted of killing Brijesh Mallaya, a landlord and his family. He is awaiting his execution in a couple of days and Abhirami has taken a vow not to marry anyone other than Niranjan.\n\nBut at home, upon the compulsion from Ravi, the family decides to get Abhirami married to Dennis. The night before wedding, Abhirami requests Dennis to take her to jail to meet Niranjan for one last time. They meet Niranjan (Mohanlal), who is a completely changed man. Remorseful Niranjan regrets the violent ways he adopted in class war and the crimes he did to obtain a classless society. Niranjan advises Abhirami to forget him and accept Dennis as her husband. Abhirami refuses to take his words, but Niranjan forces Dennis to tie the mangalsutra to Abhirami, which she has brought with her. Dennis obeys Niranjan, marries Abhirami at the jail, and Niranjan witnesses it with tearful eyes.\n\nA few days later, the family returns home, while Ravi jokingly reminds everyone that they should be back here next year to welcome junior Dennis. The train departs slowly and a girl's hand reaches out of the coach window, holding the kitten which was sent as a gift to Ravi before. Ravi takes off running to find out who it is, but he catches only a cryptic message that teases him to follow and discover her identity.\n\n\n\n\nFacebook : https://www.facebook.com/musiczoneofficial",

"description": "For More Movies Please Subscribe  http://goo.gl/yAqkeA\n\n\nSukhamo Devi is a 1986 Malayalam-language Indian romantic tragedy film directed by Venu Nagavally. The film was the directorial debut of Venu, the story was based on his own experience. It features Mohanlal, Shankar, Geetha and Urvashi in major roles.\n\nThe film features memorable soundtrack composed by Raveendran to the lyrics penned by O. N. V. Kurup and cinematography by S. Kumar. Editing of the film was done by K. P. Puthran while the assistant directors to the film were Ajayan and G. S. Vijayan with Art direction by Krishnan Kutty. The film was one of the highest grossers of 1986.\n\"Sukhamo Devi\" tells the story of two good friends: Nandan (Shankar) and Sunny (Mohanlal). Both of them are singers who are in their senior years of college but Nandan is a hard working introvert while Sunny is a well-rounded, generally sporty \"cool dude\" who always sticks with his friends. Nandan and Sunny have girlfriends Devi and Thara respectively who match them exactly in personality. Sunny also has another very loyal pal named Vinod who tends to get a bit annoying sometimes, but Sunny appreciates him nevertheless. When Sunny and Nandan graduate college with highest honors, they decide to get married to their girlfriends. Thara's parents approve Sunny, but Devi's father does not approve Nandan when he sees his job as a waiter in a restaurant. Devi's father even decides to have an arranged marriage for her, about which Nandan and Sunny get really upset. Sunny promises that he would convince Devi's father to change his mind. However, things still stay the same and Devi's arranged marriage goes on as planned. On the morning of the wedding when Devi leaves town, worse turns to worst when news arrives telling that Sunny got killed in a motorbike accident with Vinod in a critical condition at the hospital. It is later discovered that Vinod survived the accident upon losing his ability to talk. Thara gets extremely devastated and starts living her life as a widow. Nandan obeys Sunny's wishes telling him to be a playback singer for movies and eventually gains fame and wealth from doing so. From this part of the movie to the end, all the characters hear Sunny's voice in random places, making them feel him in their hearts. On one of Nandan's tours, he stays in a hotel and discovers that the clerk is Devi. He calls her later, telling her, \"Sukhamo Devi?\" (Are you doing alright, Devi?), the title of the movie. He eventually meets her husband, Dr. Venugopal who tells Nandan to move on with life and the choice wasn't his either. Meanwhile, Nandan tries to cheer up Thara who has yet to recover from the shock of Sunny's death and takes her to places. Devi leaves for Goa with her husband for good with Nandan promising her that they will unite in Heaven one day. The final scene shows Nandan and Thara watching Devi's plane leave with Sunny's voice telling Nandan to \"look after Thara like gold\".

"title": "Super Hit Malayalam  Movie | Oru CBI Diary Kurippu [ HD ] | Investigation Thriller Full Movie",
"description": "For More Movies Please Subscribe  http://goo.gl/yAqkeA\n\n\nOru CBI Diary Kurippu  is a 1988 Malayalam mystery film directed by K. Madhu, written by S. N. Swamy, and starring Mammootty, Suresh Gopi, Jagathy Sreekumar, Mukesh, and Sukumaran.\n\nThis film is the first in the series of the CBI investigative thrillers featuring Mammootty as CBI officer Sethurama Iyer. It was produced by M. Mani under the banner Sunitha Productions. Sequels to the film are Jagratha (1989), Sethurama Iyer CBI (2004), and Nerariyan CBI (2005). A fifth sequel Veendum CBI in the franchise has been announced and is now in the pre-production stage.\n\nThe plot-line of the film, Oru CBI Diary Kurippu, was crafted around a real life incidence, the Polakkulam Case in which a hotel employee was murdered and dropped from the terrace to make it look like a suicide. The case was investigated by the CBI and it was in this case that a humanoid dummy experiment was first done in the state of Kerala to prove a murder case.\n\nThe lead character, Sethurama Iyer is said to have been inspired by a police officer named Radha Vinod Raju, Jammu and Kashmir cadre IPS Officer who in 2009 was appointed as the first chief of India's National Investigation Agency. He died in Kochi on 21 June 2012 at the age of 62, due to lung complications.\n\nThe movie was a huge box office success. The background score of the film became quite popular, and years after the release of the first two sequels, became popular as mobile phone ringtones. This was one of the reasons that led the filmmakers to plan a third sequel after 15 years. All the sequels use the same background score, composed by music director Shyam.\n\nThe film was remade in Telugu as Nyayam Kosam with Dr. Rajasekhar and in Hindi as Police Public with Raaj Kumar.\nMammootty's Sethurama Iyer was initially conceived as a Muslim character, but Mammootty suggested an Iyer character to incorporate jibes of Devadas (Sukumaran) about vegetarianism and lack of Iyers to do physical work. This resulted in one of the most popular two-character confrontation scenes between Sethurama Iyer (Mammootty) and Devadas (Sukumaran). Because of the popularity, this was repeated in the sequels Jagratha and Sethurama Iyer CBI. The third sequel was released 15 years after Jagratha. By this time, Sukumaran, who had portrayed Devadas, had died. Thus, Saikumar was cast as the son of Devadas; he was required to mimic Sukumaran's style of performance.\nThe movie was one of the first of its kind to concentrate on the central investigative story only, without the songs and dances generally associated with popular Indian commercial films.\nCBI Diary Kurippu was one of the top grosser in 1988. It ran more than 200 days (175 days in TVM) in Kerala.\n\n\n\nFacebook : https://www.facebook.com/musiczoneofficial",

"description": "For More Movies Please Subscribe  http://goo.gl/yAqkeA\n\n\n\nKottayam Kunjachan is a 1990 Malayalam film directed by T. S. Suresh Babu, starring Mammootty in the title role.The movie was blockbuster of 1990.\n\nMikhael (Innocent) is a family man and good Christian who lives in the mostly tranquil village of Odaangara, with his wife Aleyamma (KPAC Lalitha). They have two daughters, Mollykutty (Ranjini) and Susie and a son, Kuttappan. They have been involved in a long-standing dispute with their neighbour, Kanjirappalli Paappan (Prathapachandran), who wants to buy their land so that his bungalow would have a better front view and a road for his car. Paappan's ruthless son, Jimmy (Babu Antony) is all for ejecting them by force, while Paappan is wary of what Aleyamma's siblings, the Uppukandam Brothers, who are infamous thugs, might do in retaliation. When negotiations fail, Paappan resorts to underhanded tactics and scuttles Mollykutty's marriage proposal to Kuzhiyil Joy (Ravi Vallathol) and beats up Mikhael who questions it. Aleyaamma get her brothers involved, and Paappan and his son are beaten and humiliated by the Uppukandam brothers, led by Korah (Sukumaran) the eldest. Later, Joy visits Mollykutty and expresses his interest in her.\n\nMeanwhile, 'Kottayam' Kunjachan (Mammotty), an erstwhile thug, has just been released from jail. He has served a sentence of 7 years, for killing a man in a fight gone bad. He makes a dramatic entrance to Kottayam town and goes to collect his promised compensation. After an altercation with his previous employers, he is arrested and later bailed out by his guardian, a Christian priest (Jose Prakash) who found him as an infant in a garbage heap, and raised him as his own. Following his father's advice, he leaves Kottayam and its bad influences for Odaangara. He starts a technical institute, accompanied by Bosco (Baiju), his assistant. He generally endears himself to the village populace. It is there that he meets Mikhael and his wife, and gets in their good books by rescuing Mollykutty from a kidnap attempt by Jimmy and gang. Aleyamma convinces Mikhael to rent out their outhouse to Kunjachan, as a deterrent from further attacks by Paappan or Jimmy. Mikhael then convinces Kunjachan to go to confession, and start living as a good Christian.\n\nKunjachan takes a liking to Molly, who despises him for his past. However, when her parents attempt her to coerce her into another marriage, Molly has Susie enlist Kunjachan's help to scuttle it, which he does masterfully. Kunjachan assumes that she returns his affections. His attempts to talk to Molly are mistaken for a rape attempt by Aleyamma. Mikhael throws him out and Kunjachan is too shocked to react. He is later beaten up by the Uppukandam brothers. Molly doesn't intervene, and she is reprimanded by Susie who realizes that Molly has used Kunjachan. Shortly afterwards, Mikhael and Korah are ambushed and killed by Jimmy and Kunjachan is the prime suspect. Kunjachan goes into hiding, and angrily confronts Molly and Susie when he gets an opportunity. Molly is aghast that Joy never showed up in her time of need and throws herself at Kunjachan's mercy. He learns that Aleyamma is missing, and Kuttappan, her son has gone in search. He convinces them that he is innocent, and goes off to find Aleyamma. He manages to rescue her and her son from Jimmy's thugs, but returns to find Molly and Susie missing and the rest of the Uppukandam brothers on the scene. They learn after beating up Paappan that the women have been taken to their plantation by Jimmy, and mount a rescue mission.\n\nMolly and Susie are rescued in the nick of time by Kunjachan, who consoles Molly after her near-rape by Jimmy. The next morning, Kunjachan is visited at his institute by the Brothers. He fears another confrontation, but they reveal that they are there to propose Molly's marriage to Kunjachan.\n\n\n\nFacebook : https://www.facebook.com/musiczoneofficial",

As luck would have it, the note gets blown away from Jikku Mon's hands, and soon disappears from view. The currency note, that has started a voyage of its own, starts telling us its story, as it moves from one hand to the next until it reaches the owner once again.\n\nPerhaps, the idea that sparked off the plot might have been interesting, but on screen, it's nothing more than one hundred and thirty minutes of torment, that serves no purpose whatsoever. There is nothing much you can do except watch the note traverse from one momentary owner to the next, and stories continue to be told.\n\nOf the stories, there are none that would manage to grab your interest. It lands on the shoulder of a woman before being thrown out of the car in which she travels. A gypsy girl takes it across to her mom (Kalaranjini) from whim it gets snatched by a nasty cop. The man passes it on to a henchman (Maqbool Salman) and orders him to kill his wife (Anju Aravind). However she manages to make him spare her life, and flees with the note in hand.\n\nLater, the currency note is handed over to a man (Kumarakom Raghunath) who helps her out in the bus, who in turn offers it to a temple priest (Rakendu). The priest, with a hope to snatch a job stint at Sabarimala, wraps it up along with a few other bundles and hands it over to the minister (Santhosh Keezhattoor) in charge. Through the hands of his maid servant (Shanta Kumari) it reaches a hospital attender (Beyon Gemini) and his girl friend (Leema Babu) who is all set to board a bus to Karnataka.\n\n\n Facebook : https://www.facebook.com/musiczoneofficial",

The film starred Jayaram and Parvathi. Mohanlal makes a cameo role.\n\nKunju Lakshmi (Parvathi) is the youngest daughter of the aristocratic Kavumpattu family in Peruvannapuram. She is pampered by her brothers and is a little arrogant. The family owns the local college.\n\nSivasankaran (Jayaram) comes to the college as a peon to replace Padmanabhan (Jagathy Sreekumar) who fails to give the promised donation to the Kavumpattu family in return for the job. Padmanabhan is despondent at the loss of his job. People in the village goad him to make life miserable for the new peon so that he would leave the job and go leaving the post vacant for Padmanabhan. Padmanabhan starts exhorting money from Sivasankaran. Sivasankaran on the other hand finds out that his job includes helping the Kavumpattu family in household chores. When he takes lunch for Kunju, she laughs at him and taunts him. In the meantime Sivasankar stands up to Padmanabhan and refuse to give him anymore of his money.\n\nPadmanabhan resorts to stealing coconuts from the Kavumpattu family estate to earn some money. Sivasankaran catches them and in the scuffle he is accused of being the thief. He is let off on the intervention of the grandmother of the family. In the meantime a love note that was written for Kunju by a classmate ends up in her book and she accuses Sivasankar of writing her the letter. Kunju gets into a fight with Sivasankaran. Her brothers join the fight and Sivasankaran declares that he will marry Kunju in 15 days. Although Kunju hates Sivasankaran at that point, she later falls in love. Her brothers try to pressurize her to marry their maid's son Achu (Mohanlal) who is actually the son of the late Vamadeva Kurupu of Kavumpattu. Ultimately, Sivasankaran and Kunju marry with Achu's help.\n\n\n\n\nJoin us on Facebook : https://www.facebook.com/musiczoneofficial",

"description": "For More Movies Please Subscribe  http://goo.gl/yAqkeA\n\nMovie Name : Hai Ramcharan\nDirector : Bommarillu Bhaskar\nProducer : Nagababu\nMusic Director : Harris Jayaraj\nCast : Ram Charan Teja, Genelia \n\nSet on the backdrop of Australia, the film opens with an angry Ram (Ram Charan), who just broke up with his girlfriend, narrating the story of his love life to a police officer, Abhishek Verma (Prakash Raj) as he defaces a graffiti of his lover while her father (Prabhu Ganesan) listens. Ram is introduced to be an youngster who loves graffiti and doesn’t believe in everlasting love. He has gone through 9 loves in his life, and thinks that love between two people eventually dies out. As a person with strong morals, he is honest and wants to love life and live with open mind, open thought and open action with his lover. Jaanu (Genelia D'Souza) studies in the same college as Ram. He falls in love with her at first sight and goes onto wooing her. She eventually ends up falling for him, but wants him to promise to love her forever. Ram, of course, nonchalantly dismisses this and explains how he cannot love her forever. This leads to a clash of their ideologies. Ram shows Jaanu how even true love stales after a while and true love cannot stay forever, while Jaanu shows him examples of everlasting love, like her friends and her parents. However he makes it clear that love between two people is never the same as it first is. Abhishek makes Ram tell him why he feels like this, and Ram explains another love in his life, Rooba (Shazahn Padamsee). He falls in love with her as she visits Hyderabad when Ram is on a foreign exchange project. He follows her to Mumbai and they both fall in love. However as time passes, the couple faces problems and Ram feels himself lying more and more just to make Rooba happy. Unable to take it anymore, he tells her that he cannot continue loving her if he has to lie and sacrifice so much for her. They break up, and through the experience Ram becomes the man he is.\n\nJoin us on Facebook : http://goo.gl/HkW2D7",

"description": "Rajamanikyam is a 2005 Malayalam film, the directorial debut of Anwar Rasheed, written by T. A. Shahid, and starring Mammootty in the title role and Rahman, Manoj K Jayan, Cochin Haneefa, Ranjith, Salim Kumar, Saikumar, Bheeman Raghu, Sindhu Menon, and Padmapriya in supporting roles. The music is composed by Alex Paul with lyrics by Gireesh Puthenchery. The film was produced by Siraj Valiyaveettil under the banner of Valiyaveettil Movie International. It tells the story of Bellary Raja a cattle baron who tries to unite his warring siblings.\n\nThe film was remade in Kannada as Bellary Naga (2009) with Vishnuvardhan in lead.\n\nIn a village in Southern Kerala bordering Tamil Nadu lives a wealthy man named Raja Rathnam Pillai (Saikumar). Following the demise of his first wife, he marries Muthu Lakshmi Ammal so that the child from his marriage will not grow up without the love and care of a mother. Unknown to him, Muthu Lakshmi already has a son, whom she calls by the name Muthu.\n\nOn the night of the wedding, Muthu knocks at the door of Raja Rathnam Pillai, demanding that he be shown his mother. Once Raja Rathnam comes to know the truth, he takes Muthu into his care, giving him love, affection and a new name, \"Rajamanikyam\". Muthu returns the favour duly, as when Raja Rathnam's son ends up killing one of the children of the village, he takes the blame and leaves the village. Several years later, Raja Rathnam's two grown-up children, Rajaselvam (Manoj K. Jayan) and Rani Rathnam (Sindhu Menon), start fighting for their father's wealth. Rajaselvam, aided by his childhood buddy Simon Nadar (Ranjith) also notches up a plot to frame his own father in a murder case. As a result, Raja Rathnam is arrested, but dies of a heart attack while being taken to prison. After his death the two siblings call the family lawyer to read out Raja Rathnam's will in public. But to their surprise, they find that control of all the assets of their father have been given to a cattle dealer in Bellary, known by the name of Bellary Raja (Mammootty). They fail to recognize that Bellary Raja is none other than Rajamanikyam. How Rajamanikyam returns to his home town to unite the warring siblings forms the rest of the story.\n\nDuring the course of the movie, Rajaselvam and Rani Rathnam tries to thwart Bellary Raja in order to regain control of their father's wealth. But Bellary Raja never falls for any of their attempts and he uses educated Raju(Rahman) to stabilize the assets of his stepfather and prevents it from getting into the hands of his siblings, thereby preserving it. Raja effectively uses the help of his thug friends to restore order in the establishment. Simon and Rajaselvam send a goon to kill Bellary from his blind side. However Bellary thwart the attempt, causing him minor wound., Rajaselvam and Simon Nadar get into an argument. Simon Nadar, who wants to harm Rajaselvam, betrays him and he is held by one of his old trade partner, who demands a lot of money for the release of Rajaselvam. Rani, unknown to this, blame Rajamanikyam in order deny them their control on their father's wealth. Rajamanikyam comes to his rescue, pays the required amount of money to release Rajaselvam. He emotionally reveal that Bellary is non other than Rajaselvam's stepbrother and Rani's elder brother. Feeling regret to fulfill his father's wish to unite their family, He leave and prepare to go back. At night Rajaselvam, being drunk came to Bellary and apologize to him where both of them settle their old enmities. He ask Bellary not to leave them and reveal the truth behind their father's death. Towards the end of the movie, Rajaselvam and Simon Nadar get into an argument which turns into a fight. Selvam, beaten badly by Simon and his goons was about to be killed. However Bellary and his men came to rescue and fight off Simon.\n\nAt the Climax, Bellari realise a bull toward Simon for killing his father and trying to destroying his family and kills him. He reunited with Rajaselvam and takes him home. The movie ends when Rajamanikyam, who is half-blind, says, \"Now I have both eyes\", signifying Raju (whom he considers a brother) and Rajaselvam.\n\n\n\nJoin us : https://www.facebook.com/musiczonemoviez",

"description": "Vathiyar  is a  Tamil action film directed by A. Venkatesh starring Arjun and Mallika Kapoor and was considered as above-average grosser at the Box Office.This was Sujatha's last film before her death.\n\nDorai (Arjun) is a do-gooder don. But a police force led by ACP Easwara Pandian (Prakash Raj) and his sidekick (Sathyan) are after him. However, the poor need him as he is a Good Samaritan running an orphanage. He has help from his friends (Manivannan and Vadivelu).\n\nBut Dorai has a problem. His mother (Sujatha) doesn’t approve of his ways. She feels that he is just a loutish goon. There is also Anjali (Mallika Kapoor), a TV journalist, who is in love with Dorai because of his dare devil ways.\n\nDorai has a past too. He was just an honest-to-goodness school teacher, who ends up as the deathly Dorai after a fire ravages a school and kills several children. The incident forces him to take on the system of venal officials and politics.\n\nNow, Dorai’s biggest task is to nip a dark and dire politician who wants to bomb the city. The rest, as they, is all cinematic clichés.\n\n\n\nComing Soon.....

"title": "Malayalam Full Movie | Oru CBI Diary Kurippu Full Movie | Ft. Mammootty, Jagathi, Suresh Gopi",
"description": "Oru CBI Diary Kurippu  is a 1988 Malayalam mystery film directed by K. Madhu, written by S. N. Swamy, and starring Mammootty, Suresh Gopi, Jagathy Sreekumar, Mukesh, and Sukumaran.\n\nThis film is the first in the series of the CBI investigative thrillers featuring Mammootty as CBI officer Sethurama Iyer. It was produced by M. Mani under the banner Sunitha Productions. Sequels to the film are Jagratha (1989), Sethurama Iyer CBI (2004), and Nerariyan CBI (2005). A fifth sequel Veendum CBI in the franchise has been announced and is now in the pre-production stage.\n\nThe plot-line of the film, Oru CBI Diary Kurippu, was crafted around a real life incidence, the Polakkulam Case in which a hotel employee was murdered and dropped from the terrace to make it look like a suicide. The case was investigated by the CBI and it was in this case that a humanoid dummy experiment was first done in the state of Kerala to prove a murder case.\n\nThe lead character, Sethurama Iyer is said to have been inspired by a police officer named Radha Vinod Raju, Jammu and Kashmir cadre IPS Officer who in 2009 was appointed as the first chief of India's National Investigation Agency. He died in Kochi on 21 June 2012 at the age of 62, due to lung complications.\n\nThe movie was a huge box office success. The background score of the film became quite popular, and years after the release of the first two sequels, became popular as mobile phone ringtones. This was one of the reasons that led the filmmakers to plan a third sequel after 15 years. All the sequels use the same background score, composed by music director Shyam.\n\nThe film was remade in Telugu as Nyayam Kosam with Dr. Rajasekhar and in Hindi as Police Public with Raaj Kumar.\nMammootty's Sethurama Iyer was initially conceived as a Muslim character, but Mammootty suggested an Iyer character to incorporate jibes of Devadas (Sukumaran) about vegetarianism and lack of Iyers to do physical work. This resulted in one of the most popular two-character confrontation scenes between Sethurama Iyer (Mammootty) and Devadas (Sukumaran). Because of the popularity, this was repeated in the sequels Jagratha and Sethurama Iyer CBI. The third sequel was released 15 years after Jagratha. By this time, Sukumaran, who had portrayed Devadas, had died. Thus, Saikumar was cast as the son of Devadas; he was required to mimic Sukumaran's style of performance.\nThe movie was one of the first of its kind to concentrate on the central investigative story only, without the songs and dances generally associated with popular Indian commercial films.\nCBI Diary Kurippu was one of the top grosser in 1988. It ran more than 200 days (175 days in TVM) in Kerala.\n\nComing Soon.....

"description": "Kochuraman (V. K. Sreeraman) is the village toddy collector with a well-built body and a strong personality. Kochuraman leads a simple and happy life with his wife and son Kochuvava. Manorama Thampuratti is the daughter of a feudal lord of the ruling family in the village. Thampuratti falls for Kochuraman and tries to gain his attention ignoring the vast communal gap between them and manage to seduce Kochuraman in to her bedroom. The feudal lord who comes to know his daughter's misadventures results in Kochuraman being brutally murdered for entering into an illicit relationship with his daughter and Manorama thampuratti is paralysed for rest of her life by a deadly kick of the Thampuran in his rage. Kochuvava witnesses his father's severed body lying in the pool of blood under a coconut tree and despite his young age he swears revenge upon his father's murderers and grows up into a ruthless patriarch amassing huge wealth in sometimes illegal ways and ends up buying everything in the village including the kovilakam of his arch enemies. For Kochuvava (Thilakan) nothing is more important than money and revenge in his life and even his wife (Kaviyoor Ponnamma) and son (Vineeth) are secondary when it comes to that. In the blindness revenge as he bullies up everything and anything who dares to stand up to him. Despite being uneducated he manages the modernisation around him in his own ways and manages his empire in ruthless efficiency. He plans to exact his ultimate vengeance by starting an illicit arrack business from the kovilakam, to drive out the last residents of the kovilakam after which he plans to dig a pond where the kovilalkam stands today. For Kochuvava drinking a handful of water from that pond will mark his completion of his vengeance. However, this evil plan is strongly resented by his son who also happens to be in love with the younger Kochuthampuratti (Anju) of the kovilakam. The film ends in a bitter tragedy for Kochuvava who finally succumbs to a defeat in life and realises there are more things to life than money, power or revenge.\n\n\n\nComing Soon.....

The writer-director duo is often credited for revolutionising Malayalam cinema with their expressive and innovative works.\n\nPrayanam stars Mohan Sharma, Kottarakkara Sreedharan Nair, Master Raghu, Lakshmi, Kaviyoor Ponnamma and Nanditha Bose. It probes into the realities that existed within the Brahmin community of the day. Kottarakkara Sreedharan Nair plays an elderly Brahmin priest married to a girl young enough to be his daughter.\n\nBharathan produced the film as well as did the art direction. Music is composed by M. B. Sreenivasan with lyrics by Vayalar, Yatheendra Das and Bichu Thirumala. Bharathan remade the film into Tamil as Savithri in 1980, but could not repeat the success.\n\nComing Soon.....

"title": "Malayalam Full Movie | Season | Padmarajan Movie | Mohanlal, Jagathi Sreekumar, Thilakan",
"description": "Season is a 1989 Malayalam-language Indian feature film directed Padmarajan, starring Mohanlal and Gavin Packard in lead roles. The film, though a failure at the box office, stands apart because of Padmarajan's story-telling style, realistic portrayal of drug trade in Kovalam and flawless performance of Mohanlal and is considered now as a cult classic. The story is set in beautiful locales of Kovalam beach in Kerala and Poojappura Central Prison, Trivandrum.\n\nThe film also showed how narration can be used as a strong tool in storytelling. Many feel that this movie was much ahead of time and if it would have released in late nineties, would have done good business.\nJeevan (Mohanlal) is taken to central jail from court. It is the year 1988. In his own words, \"My name is Jeevan. I feel so depressed to know that I can't see this snow filled morning and the street lamps for years; but little would benefit in regretting now\".\n\nThe story now moves back to 1982, at Kovalam where Jeevan is running a restaurant. He also is involved in sale and purchase of several smuggled foreign goods along with transfer of foreign currency. Popularly and fondly called by everyone as 'Uncle', Jeevan is one of the richest businessman in Kovalam, and has no bad vices. He is a real mystery to all, as he also keeps everyone away from his personal life. Porinju (Ashokan)and Kanthi (Maniyan Pilla Raju), two jobless youths are involved in small time drug business to meet the both ends. Both have their own families and personal issues and dreamof being rich one day. They happen to meet Fabien, a European tourist, who wants them to fetch him three kilos of brown sugar. Both Porinju and Kanthi get allured into this deal. Jeevan supports them by lending 1.5 lakhs, on the condition that they will give up drug trade after the deal is closed. Both Porinju and Kanthi leave for Goa. They return a week later at night with the stuff. They directly go to the restaurant run by Jeevan and inform him about it. Jeevan warns them to be careful. Fabien is informed about the stuff and asked to arrive at the lighthouse late in the light. At the lighthouse, Fabien plays foul and shoots down Porinju. Meanwhile Merlin (Leena Nair), the girl friend of Fabien breaks into the Jeevan's place and steals around four lakhs rupees along with gold. On getting the information Jeevan comes to the house, but find it completely ransacked. Kanthi, who got escaped from Fabien reaches Jeevan and informs him about the death of Porinju. He takes Jeevan to the hut where Fabien was staying with Merlin. But Fabien had within the time escaped with the currency and drugs. He had jilted even Merlin. She was assaulted and left back. Jeevan finds her with both hands and legs tied. She informs him that Fabien is already on his way and they won't be able to chase him. She also informs that he is a psychopath killer. Kanthi takes Jeevan's car and leaves to chase Fabien, but is killed on the way by him. The next day, the police recover the bodies of Porinju and Kanthi. Jeevan is shocked to find that Merlin has also committed suicide by taking sleeping pills. Jeevan is main suspect as Kanthi's body was found in his car and Merlin was found dead in his house. He is arrested and sentenced to 7 years in prison. But the prosecution couldn't nail for murders of Porinju and Kanthi as there were no proofs. He gets 5 year jail term for the death of Merlin. It was just weeks before his release that Fabien enters his jail. Jeevan agrees to help Fabien in escaping from jail, if he pays Rs 5 lakhs. After the release, Jeevan plans everything and is back in jail for a petty crime. His sole aim is to finish of Fabien. The film then cuts to the present. On the day of Gandhijayanthi, when, all the cops are busy with the celebrations. Jeevan escapes from jail with Fabien. On their way, Fabien collects Rs. 5 lakhs from an agent and pays it to Jeevan. After collecting the amount, Jeevan in a fiery fight finishes of Fabien. Jeevan goes back to jail when his voice over comes in background with the visual of him driving the van and images of passing street lights in the plain glass of the van \"I am getting sad to know that I am going to miss these street lights again.I had great comfort when she (one of his friend's lovers) accepted the money (that Jeevan took from Fabien) and the happy thing for me is that this time is that they won't have any circumstantial evidences against me; but only evidence, the real evidence. Its on my shirt, on my face, on my hands...and everywhere \". He smiles triumphantly and reaches back at the prison. When the cops ask about Fabien, Jeevan walks with a winning smile and opens the door of the van where the cops find Fabien's corpse.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor More Movies Please Subscribe  http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVgAX4cKkI3VhYtVmHUBASg?sub_confirmation=1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJoin us : https://www.facebook.com/musiczonemoviez",

"title": "Malayalam Full Movie | Kaala Varkey -  Jagathi Sreekumar, Suvarna",
"description": "Director: Rajesh Narayanan \nProducer: R S K Manikandan \nMusic Director: Paul Varghese \nLyricst: S. Rameshan Nair , Chunakkara Ramankutty \n\n\nIn the film, the most talented comedian actor has tried for an image change as an aggressive, crude and brazen man who breeds and deals in bulls. The locals call him 'kaala' Varkey, as he is a man who cares more for his bulls than his wife Annamma (Pallavi) and three daughters Alice (Suvarna Mathew), Sophia (Meenakshi) and Lisy (Krishnendu). His wife hates him, as he is an alcoholic and womaniser. He beats her up brutally and so she keeps quiet about his wayward habits. But in an accident, Varkey becomes bedridden and a guy from another village Jose (Vijayaraghavan) comes to look after the bulls. This man arrives with a purpose and his aim is to see the downfall of Varkey. Jose not only takes control of the family, but molests Annamma. Varkey repents about his past but is unable to do anything. Jose eyes Alice, but Varkey arranges her marriage with another guy. Jose takes revenge by selling the bull to the butcher. But in the climax, the bull kills Jose and Varkey gets up from the bed.\n\nThe story has nothing new and the only USP is Jagathy Sreekumar as 'kaala' Varkey. His performance is matured and so is Vijayaraghavan as Jose. The film has far too many double meaning dialogues and vulgar jokes. The director has to take the blame for making a crude film that will neither please the classes nor the masses.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor More Movies Please Subscribe  http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVgAX4cKkI3VhYtVmHUBASg?sub_confirmation=1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJoin us : https://www.facebook.com/musiczonemovie",

"title": "Malayalam Full Movie | Iruttinte Athmavu [ ഇരുട്ടിന്റെ ആത്മാവ് ]",
"description": "Iruttinte Athmavu  is a 1967 Malayalam film directed by P. Bhaskaran and written by M. T. Vasudevan Nair based on his own story with the same name.It stars Prem Nazir, Sharada, Thikkurissy Sukumaran Nair, P. J. Antony, Ushakumari, Kozhikode Shantha Devi and Baby Rajani in important roles, and features music by M. S. Baburaj, cinematography by E. N. Balakrishnan and editing by G. Venkitaraman and Das.\n\nThe film is about a mentally retarded youth born into a matriarchal family who is forced to live as a mad man in chains and who is misunderstood and ill-treated by everyone except his uncle's daughter. Prem Nazir played the mentally challenged Bhranthan Velayudhan, widely accepted to be an extra ordinary performance and one of the best in his career. Nazir himself rated his role of Velayudhan in Iruttinte Athmavu and as the swashbuckling folk hero Thampan in Padayottam as his best. Also, its script is regarded as one of the finest by M. T. Vasudevan Nair. A major landmark in Malayalam cinema, the film provided Malayalam cinema with a new direction; that of the low-budget film. The film has earned a dedicated cult following. It won the National Film Award for Best Film on Other Social Issues. It missed the Best Film award only narrowly. Despite all the acclaim, the film was a box office failure.\nVelayudan's existence poses a problem to all the members of the joint family. Velayudhan is a twenty - year old man, but he has the intelligence of a child. The head of the joint family thinks Velayudan symbolizes the curse which hangs heavy over the house. To his mother he is source of constant sorrow. His uncle's daughter is his would be bride. He is attached to her. She is very kind to him and refuses to treat him as a mad man. Velayudan triggers problems one after the other and every new lapse help only to put fresh chains. He refuses to feel he is mad. In the end Ammukutty is given away in marriage to an old widower. Velayudhan surrenders himself and yells \"Chain me I am mad!\"\nThe film is scripted by M. T. Vasudevan Nair based on his own a short story with the same name. The screenplay is regarded as one of the finest by the noted writer. One could see a lot of the pre-occupations of the scenarist, who carried the touches of human relationships through all of his subsequent films whether as screenplay writer or director. A part of the screenplay of Iruttinte Athmavu is being taught in school classes while the complete screenplay is being taught at degree level.\nThe film provided Malayalam cinema with a new direction; that of the low-budget film. In spite of its large number of studio shots and overall theatricality, the film was so culturally rich that many of the episodes would become archetypes for future Malayalam film makers dealing with family drama.M. S. Baburaj composed the songs while P. Bhaskaran penned the lyrics. S. Janaki is the vocalist. The song \"Eeranuduthukondambaram Chuttunna\" is considered one of the best songs of both Baburaj and S. Janaki.\n\n\n\nFor More Movies Please Subscribe  http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVgAX4cKkI3VhYtVmHUBASg?sub_confirmation=1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJoin us : https://www.facebook.com/musiczonemoviez",

There is a Priest called Vattakkuzhi Achan who supports this all drama program. Paappachan's mother not much interested in Drama. She always ask him to take care of her cow, this brings a very funny appearance in movie. Kumaran is running the barber shop in Kurupp's building. Kurupp is a very misery person. He don't know about the affair in between them. Movie goes on gear with the Drama. Chief Minister came to inaugurate it. He got impressed and possessed for a photo session.

"description": "Swapnadanam  is a 1976 black-and-white Malayalam-language film that marks the directorial debut of K. G. George. A marital psychodrama, it rejected all the usual song-dance numbers of popular cinema, yet succeeded in reaching the common mass. The film was a commercial success while maintaining its artistic quality. It won the Kerala State Film Award for Best Film and National Film Award for Best Feature Film in Malayalam. The cast includes Rani Chandra, Dr. Mohandas, Soman, Mallika and P. K. Venukuttan Nair.\nThe story proceeds in a flashbacks as the hero, Dr. Gopi, who has had a nervous breakdown, relives his past under psychiatric probing. It is the story of an ill-matched marriage — the husband, sensitive, introvertive and plagued by memories of a bygone love and the wife, rich, spoilt and self-centred — and how under the mounting stresses of daily life, the husband cracks up. Gopi is the only son of a widowed mother, and in strained circumstances, is put through medical college by his rich uncle on the understanding that Gopi marries his daughter Sumithra. Gopi, while in college, falls in love with a fellow-student, but they part company when his mother meets the girl and persuades her to give up the betrothed Gopi. Gopi's marriage with his rich cousin takes place, but it is doomed from its very start. They are not made for each other in either taste or temperament, and besides Gopi is haunted by memories of his former love. And Gopi, being the introvert he is, consummates the marriage, as it were, in a psychiatric \nward.\n\n\n\nFor More Movies Please Subscribe:\n  http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVgAX4cKkI3VhYtVmHUBASg?sub_confirmation=1\n\n\n\n\nJoin us : https://www.facebook.com/musiczonemoviez",

Sudhi loves his wife a lot. But he is also possessive and highly suspicious of her, who is beautiful. One night he sees a man run out of his house when returning from work. He accuses Sarala of infidelity and this forces her to leave the house. He concludes that she had been sexually involved with his friend Sasidharan Nair (K. P. Ummer). A few months later, he discovers that the man he saw the other day was actually Sasidharan's wife Kamalakshi's (Khadeeja) extramarital partner. He is filled with remorse. He now wants to bring Sarala back into his life. But, it was too late. Sarala's father Pillai (Adoor Bhasi) had already married her off to Neelakanta Pillai (Sankaradi), a widower.

"description": "Kadalpalam is a 1969 Malayalam language film directed by K. S. Sethumadhavan. Sathyan, Prem Nazir, Jayabharathi, Sheela, Bahadoor and Adoor Bhasi star in the lead.The film is an adaptation of the very popular professional stage play of the same name authored by the renowned dramatist K. T. Mohammed which is an adaptation of 1940 Hindi film Prem Nagar. The film was critically well received and was a box office hit. It is probabily best remembered for the performance by Sathyan, who received the first ever State Award for his performance.\n\n\nhe story revolves round the family of Narayana Kaimal (Sathyan), a leading advocate who loses his eyesight. Kaimal is a strict disciplinarian and always tries to impose his thoughts and principles on his children and fellow beings. This creates a conflict with others. Kaimal's elder son Raghu (Sathyan) dislikes the obstinate nature of his father leading to constant conflicts between the two. Kaimal's younger son Prabhakaran (K. P. Ummer) who is an advocate and daughter Geetha (Jayabharathi) try to obey their father, but at times they only pretend to obey him. Kaimal now sees the world through the eyes of his faithful servant Appu (Bahadur).\n\nPrabhakaran is in love with Sarala (Sheela), daughter of Kaimal's servant Sreedharan Pillai (Sankaradi). Geetha is in love with Murali (Prem Nazir), the adopted son of Kadeeja (Adoor Bhavani), who lives in the neighbourhood. Appu is warned against telling anything about the love affairs to Kaimal. Raghu believes that they lost their mother at very young age only because of the arrogance of their father. Raghu is married to Prashanthi (Vijayachandrika) who was his father's choice.\n\nRaghu shows his protest by his rude behaviour towards his wife. Kaimal demands to give back the tile factory which he had given to Raghu. But Raghu refuses to part with the factory. Kaimal files a court case against his son.\n\nGeetha marries Murali and Raghu supports them. Kaimal regains his eyesight and is thunderstruck to know about the happenings that took place while he was blind. He decides to pretend to be blind so as to know more about his children. Only Appu is aware that Kaimal is now not blind. Kaimal plots to stop the marriage of Prabhakaran. He offers partnership of the factory to the manager Nanukuttan Nair (Adoor Bhasi) if he could help conduct the marriage of his son, who is a police inspector, with Sarala. Nair agrees to carry out the crooked plan.\n\nThe verdict of the court goes against Kaimal. But Prabhakaran hides this from his father. Prabhakaran does not allow Geetha to meet Kaimal and when Kadeeja come and raises voice for justice, Kaimal hits her. Murali attacks Kaimal and now all come to know that Kaimal is not blind. Prabhakaran comes to know about the crooked plan of his father. All the children turn against Kaimal. Unable to stand the setback and the thought that he had failed in his attempts to control his children with an iron hand he suffers a heart attack and dies.\n\n\nFor More Movies Please Subscribe  http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVgAX4cKkI3VhYtVmHUBASg?sub_confirmation=1\n\n\n\n\nJoin us : https://www.facebook.com/musiczonemoviez",

"title": "Jagapoga Malayalam Full Movie High Quality",
"description": "There is a saying; every man has seven look-alikes somewhere in the world. So Director Dhanwanthari has assembled the look-alikes of superstar Mammootty, Mohanlal, Late Jayan, Dileep, Biju Menon, Cochin Haneefa, Lal and others and made a film Jagapoga. Nothing illegal about it except the real superstars is angry about it. Who cares as the film turns out to be a comedy caper.\n\nThe story is borrowed bits and shards from half a dozen super hits like Nadodi Kattu, CBI Dairy Kurupu, Pattana Pravesam, Dada Saheb etc etc. The audience who have seen the original, find great fun when they see the duplicates imitating their heroes. An idol is stolen from the local temple, and the Priest commits suicide. Two local policemen Ajayan and Vijayan are asked to investigate the case. They arrest the Priest's son and interrogate him but he dies in Police custody. This puts the CID's in a piquant situation and they run away and hide in a godown. By chance they meet a 'Kuttichatthan' (genie) called 'Kuttappi' who changes their lives and the investigation. The local village Chief Dada Saheb is said to be behind all the crimes. How Ajayan and Vijayan solve the crime is told in a slapstick comedy manner.\n\nThe film is based on a popular TV serial by the same name on Kairali TV. On the whole couple of look-alikes of popular stars do take-offs of the original creating a good laugh.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor More Movies Please Subscribe  http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVgAX4cKkI3VhYtVmHUBASg?sub_confirmation=1\n\n\n\n\nJoin us : https://www.facebook.com/musiczonemoviez?ref=hl",
