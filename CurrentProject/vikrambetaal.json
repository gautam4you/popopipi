The series contained stories from Indian mythology that aim at teaching kids life lessons while entertaining them. The concept of the program was based on Baital Pachisi, a collection of tales about the legendary King Vikram (identified as Vikramāditya) and the Vetala, a ghost analogous to a vampire in Western literature.\nVikram Aur Betaal is based on Betaal Pacchisi, written nearly 2,500 years ago by Mahakavi Somdev Bhatt. These are spellbinding stories told to the wise King Vikramaditya by the wily ghost Betaal.\nAt the beginning of the frame story, Vikramaditya king of Ujjain receives, among other visitors, a mendicant who presents the king a fruit on every visit. In the fruits are later discovered orbs of ruby. Upon this discovery, the king resolves to visit the mendicant, who arranges a meeting under a banyan tree in a cremation ground beyond the city, at night, on the 14th day of the dark half of the month. At the meeting, the mendicant requests that Vikramaditya bring him a corpse suspended from another tree, with which the mendicant might achieve occult power.\nUpon Vikramaditya's doing so, the corpse is identified as Betaal, the ghost, who narrates a story to the king, concluding that Vikramaditya must answer a moral question pertaining to the story's characters, on pain of his own death; and upon his answering the question, Betaal returns to his tree.\n \n1 \"King Vikramaditya and the Yogi / Suryamal and His Bride's Dilemma\" Balwant Bansal as Mantri\nRamesh Bhatkar as the bride's father\nGagan Gupta as soldier\nSatish Kaul as Suryamal\n\nShort Summary: The first episode shows the story of how Raja Vikramaditya and Betaal meet. Beetal tells him a story of Suryamal, who falls in love with a woman and marries her with her parents' consent. En route to home, dacoits attack and behead Suryamal and his friend. Suryamal's bride, a devout worshipper of goddess Durga, tries to commit suicide after seeing her husband dead. Goddess answers her prayers and decides to bring them both alive. Excited with joy, bride puts Suryamal's head on his friend's body and vice versa.\nQuestion: Betaal asks, who should the bride now consider as her husband; the man who has Suryamal's head or Suryamal's body?\nAnswer: Vikram answers, as brain controls whole man, the man with Suryamal's head is the bride's husband.\n\n\n*********************************************************\n*********************************************************\nTHANKS FOR WATCHING,\nLIKE,COMMENT AND SUBSCRIBE",

On her way she meets a Birdman who understands and talks with birds. Impressed by his unique skill she asks him to come to the palace and teach her too. She then meets a Weaver whose woven cloth is very fine and has good export demand. She wishes that she could weave with such ability. On her journey ahead she falls ill and is hence treated by a Vaid (Doctor in Hindi language). Looking at the philanthropic work he does, she expresses that she too wishes to leave her palace and help poor people just like he does. On her way back home, she is attacked by dacoits and a Brave Man saves her. Back in her palace, the King decides that she should now get married and announces that all suitable Grooms can present themselves.\nQuestion: Of the Birdman, Weaver, Doctor and the Brave Man who will the Princess marry?\nAnswer: Vikram replies that the Princess will marry the Brave Man as with him she would always be secure. Other attractions she had for other men would not last long enough.\n\n\n*********************************************************\n*********************************************************\nTHANKS FOR WATCHING,\nLIKE,COMMENT AND SUBSCRIBE",

He is hence kicked out of the home. Wandering, he meets a saint who with his yogic powers can bring forth anything that one wants. Gunkar asks the saint to teach him power. Saint agrees and asks him to follow the two-fold way of attaining the power. Midway after completing first step Gunkar decides to go home and meet his family. He asks saint to bring in some clothes to take to his home as gifts. After returning, Gunkar finishes his second step. But he is not able to get the power.\nQuestion: Betaal ask for what reason Gunkar could not attain the power although he did just as he was instructed by the saint?\nAnswer: Vikram answers that Gunkar failed as he did not follow the way properly as he was distracted and cut it into two and went home.\n\n\n*********************************************************\n*********************************************************\nTHANKS FOR WATCHING,\nLIKE,COMMENT AND SUBSCRIBE",
